Delaunay-psm
----------------

This is a mirror of the delaunay-psm (Pluggable Software Module) from the Geogram library for the delaunay triangulation.

The full library was hosted at [here](http://alice.loria.fr/index.php/software/4-library/75-geogram.html) and the sources for both the library and the PSM version are hosted [here](https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=5833).

This repository just allows to build and link the library using cmake. No other changes are made beside the building system.

### Build

The library has no dependency so it can be built with the typical
```shell
mkdir build && cd build 
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=<prefix>
make -j 4
```

Note that the whole thing can be built as simply as

```shell
g++ Delaunay_psm.cpp Delaunay_example.cpp -o Delaunay_example
```

### Use as 3rd party

In order to use this library as 3rd party in your project, you simply need to import the `delaunayConfig.cmake` generated by the build process (usually in `build/geogram/generated`).
If you install the library, say in `<prefix>`, then the config is installed in `<prefix>/lib/cmake/delaunay`.
Either way, the file exposes a target `delaunay-psm::delaunay` that can be used to link with your project.

In your cmake project you simply have to

```cmake
find_package(delaunay-psm CONFIG REQUIRED)

add_executable(myDelaunaySample main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(myDelaunaySample delaunay-psm::delaunay)
```

Check the [example](example/CMakeLists.txt).
